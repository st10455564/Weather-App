Developers can create branches, submit pull requests, and review code changes—all within the GitHub repository. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) with GitHub Actions: GitHub Actions automates the CI/CD pipeline. CI Workflow: On every code push or pull request, GitHub Actions runs tests, checks code quality, and ensures compatibility. If any issues arise, developers receive immediate feedback. CD Workflow: Once code passes CI checks, GitHub Actions deploys it to a staging environment. After further testing, successful changes are automatically deployed to production. Scheduled Tasks and Event-Driven Workflows: GitHub Actions can trigger workflows based on events (e.g., code pushes, pull requests) or schedules (e.g., nightly backups)
